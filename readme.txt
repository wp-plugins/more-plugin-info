Connects to the WordPress.org Plugin API to display additional plugin information about
installed plugins, such as number of downloads and rating.

== Description ==

Ever wish that the plugins page on your WordPress site had more information about the plugins that you have installed?

You shouldn't have to open up another tab and search for the plugin on wordpress.org just to find out things like:
When was it last updated? How many ratings does it have? What version of WordPress has it been tested up to?

This plugin resolves that issue- it grabs details about all of the plugins on your site from wordpress.org, and displays them right there underneath each plugin's description. It also includes a settings page, so you can choose which information you want to be shown.

There aren't a lot of unnecessary bells and whistles here- this is a secure, clean-cut way to customize the information shown on your plugins page.

Enjoy!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `more-plugin-info` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings > More Plugin Info and click on the 'Update Plugin Data Now' button to pull data from WordPress.org

== Screenshots == 

1. An example plugin as seen on the plugin listing page; note the 'Average Rating' and 'Number of Ratings' values. Many additional values may be shown as well. 
2. The More Plugin Info settings page permits field toggle, as well as auto or manual sync down of plugin data from WordPress.org.
